No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right.
Mistakes are proof that you are trying.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.
It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.
Learning never exhausts the mind.
Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
You don’t have to be perfect to be amazing.
There is no elevator to success. You have to take the stairs.
In a world where you can be anything, be kind.
Live life to the fullest and focus on the positive.
You must be the change you wish to see in the world.
Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.
